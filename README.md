## What is micromanaging? 

Micromanaging is a management style where you have excessive control over every detail and aspect of the project without regard to the impact on others or yourself.

1. Have a hard time asking for help
1. Check in frequently to see if the work is being done/done your way
1. Monitor every detail, even the smallest ones
1. Believe that no one can produce what you can
1. Donâ€™t take advice or suggestions from others
1. Make all the decisions involved in the project
1. Believe others are likely to waste time or resources
